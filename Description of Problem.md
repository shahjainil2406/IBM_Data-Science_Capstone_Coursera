# Description of Problem
The difficult we are managing is that if we somehow happened to open up a store in a territory one would need to choose various components. One of those variables is the nearby rivalry. If one somehow managed to open up a store for model a food store in a territory where there are as of now 25+ stores present then the opening up of another store probably won't have an extraordinary effect. There is another approach to look at this which is that from the size of the current market you can judge how large a specific industry is in that showcase. For instance, in the event that you have an alternate thought or approach for your thought you can procure bigger benefits on the off chance that you enter a district where food interests a bigger number of individuals.
